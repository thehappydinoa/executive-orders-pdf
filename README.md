### Basic Usage

```bash
python cli.py [URL] --output [OUTPUT_FILE] --download-dir [DOWNLOAD_DIR]
```

### Using Configuration File

You can also use a configuration file to set default options:

```

### Specifying President and Year

```bash
python cli.py --president donald-trump --year 2025
```

## Development

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. For development, install development dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

4. Set up pre-commit hooks (Optional)

```bash
pre-commit install
```

5. Run the script

```bash
# Replace YYYY with the current year (e.g., 2025)
python cli.py --president donald-trump --year YYYY
```

For example, in 2025 you would run:

```bash
python cli.py --president donald-trump --year 2025
```

You can also use the configuration file:

```bash
python cli.py --config config.yaml
```

## Running Tests
